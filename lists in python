# I have done lot of changes in code, so I comment lot of things, make sure do changes according to your requirements

# #lets create a list

# #list items are ordered, changeable and alows duplication
# #List items can be of any data type:

# cars = ["BMW", "Civic", "Toyota", "Tesla", "BMW", 5]
# #print the list

# #we can check length of list(how many items in list) by len() function
# print(len(cars))

# print a specific item from list by indexing

# fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange", 500, 199]
#print([3])
#range where to start and where to end
#print(fruits[3:6])
#starting index will be included but ending will not include

#check if specific item exist in list

# if 500 in fruits:
#     print("Yes, this number is persent!")

#change list items, this method will delete that index number existig value

# fruits[1] = "Watermelon"
# print(fruits)

#change range of list items, this method will delete that index number existig value

# fruits[1:3] = "Coconut", "Strawberry"
# print(fruits)

#add items without deleting existing values by instert() function

# fruits.insert(3, "Watermelon")
# print(fruits)

#can add items through append() method, it will add at end of the list

# fruits.append(1000)
# print(fruits)

#we can extend current list by adding new list in it, this method will new list at the end of current list

# newfruits = ["Watermelon", "Coconut", 5000]
#you can even add tuple, sets, disctionaries to list
# newfruitsset = ("Watermelon", "Coconut", 5000)
# fruits.extend(newfruitsset)

# print(fruits)

#remove items from list have different methods.
#first method to remove specific item from list by remove() method

#if dupplicate items in list, it will remove first occurance
# fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange", "Apple", 500, 199]
# fruits.remove("Apple")
# print(fruits)

#second method to remove item by specific index by pop() method

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange", "Apple", 500, 199]
# fruits.pop(2)
#empty pop will remove last item
# fruits.pop()
# print(fruits)

#third method is by del keyword

# del fruits[2]
#del can delete complete list. It will show a error.
# del fruits
# print(fruits)

#fourth method will just clear the list, list will remian but content will not

fruits.clear()
print(fruits)
