# I have done lot of changes in code, so I comment lot of things, make sure do changes according to your requirements

# #lets create a list

# #list items are ordered, changeable and alows duplication
# #List items can be of any data type:

# cars = ["BMW", "Civic", "Toyota", "Tesla", "BMW", 5]
# #print the list

# #we can check length of list(how many items in list) by len() function
# print(len(cars))

# print a specific item from list by indexing

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Orange", 500, 199]
#print([3])
#range where to start and where to end
#print(fruits[3:6])
#starting index will be included but ending will not include

#check if specific item exist in list

if "Mango" in fruits:
    print("Yes, Mango is persent!")
