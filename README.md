Python for Beginners
Welcome to the "Python for Beginners" repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Python from scratch and practicing daily.

<b>About</b>
In this repository, you will find various Python programs and exercises that I have completed as part of my learning process. The goal is to improve my Python skills by consistently practicing, even if it's just writing a single line of code each day.

Contents
Basic Syntax and Concepts: Programs covering the basics of Python syntax, variables, data types, and more.
Control Flow: Examples of if-else statements, loops, and other control structures.
Data Structures: Practice programs using lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
Functions and Modules: Exercises on creating and using functions, as well as importing modules.
Projects: Small projects that apply the concepts learned to solve real-world problems.
How to Use
Feel free to explore the repository and use the code to enhance your own learning. Each program is accompanied by comments and explanations to help understand the logic and concepts.
